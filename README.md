Go to "http://portforward.com/softwareguides/minecraft/portforward-minecraft.htm" and run the things I also included
You'll need your router model, but portforward.com gives you all the guides to get it connected.
Another helpful program is Github Desktop, download that at "https://desktop.github.com/".
    By helpful, I mean it does all the work for you. So get it.
Also, add your names to "whitelist.json", we'll just make it private once its live. 

Whoever want to host the server, just sync your local folder with the online one, easy as hitting Sync on Github Desktop.

When you're done, click the broken circle on the far right of the timeline, write something in the Summary box on the bottom, and everything will be saved for whoever hosts it next. This way whoever needs to host it a certain day can.
If you are stubborn and didn't download Github Desktop, then you have to click Upload Files on the repository page, and upload each and every file manually.
