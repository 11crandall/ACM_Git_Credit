Go to "http://portforward.com/softwareguides/minecraft/portforward-minecraft.htm" and run the things I also included
You'll need your router model, but portforward.com gives you all the guides to get it connected.
Also, add your names to "whitelist.json", we'll just make it private once its live. 

Whoever want to host the server, just create a branch from the main set, add you IP address to the top of this file, and run it from your computer.

When you're done, request a pull, and everything will be saved for whoever hosts it next. This way whoever needs to host it a certain day can.
